    Performs forward propagation over a convolutional layer
    of a neural network

    A_prev is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h_prev, w_prev, c_prev)
        containing the output of the previous layer
        m is the number of examples
        h_prev is the height of the previous layer
        w_prev is the width of the previous layer
        c_prev is the number of channels in the previous layer
    W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kh, kw, c_prev, c_new) containing
        the kernels for the convolution
        kh is the filter height
        kw is the filter width
        c_prev is the number of channels in the previous layer
        c_new is the number of channels in the output
    b is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, 1, 1, c_new) containing the
        biases applied to the convolution
    activation is an activation function applied to the convolution
    padding is a string that is either same or valid, indicating
        the type of padding used
    stride is a tuple of (sh, sw) containing the strides for the
        convolution
        sh is the stride for the height
        sw is the stride for the width
